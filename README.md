Blockstack is a new decentralized internet where you own your data and your apps run locally without remote servers.

Blockstack provides decentralized services for naming/DNS, identity, authentication and storage. Developers can use JavaScript libraries to build serverless apps and they don't need to worry about managing infrastructure. Blockstack replaces the current client/server model; users control their data, apps run client-side, and the open Blockstack network replaces server-side functionality.

## Architecture

Blockstack has been used in production for 3+ years and [70,000+ domains](https://resolver.onename.com/v2/namespaces) have been registered using it.

With the Blockstack software, a network of computers collectively maintain a global registry of names. When you run a Blockstack node, you join this network, which is more secure by design than traditional DNS and identity systems. This is because the system's registry and its records are secured by an underlying blockchain, which is extremely resilient against tampering and control.

In the registry that makes up Blockstack, each of the names has an owner, represented by a cryptographic keypair, and is associated with instructions for how DNS resolvers and other software should resolve the name.

Different layers of Blockstack are shown in the following figure:

## Code

If you're just starting with Blockstack, here are the main software repositories you should checkout:

- [Blockstack Core](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core) - the reference implementation of Blockstack's Consensus core written in Python.
- [Blockstack Browser](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser) - the Blockstack Browser provides a graphical interface for interactions with the network.
- [blockstack.js](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js) - a JavaScript library for using Blockstack identity, authentication, and gaia storage in your apps.
