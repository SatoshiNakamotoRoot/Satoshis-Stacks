The Blockchain Name System (BNS), formerly known as Openname, is very similar to the Domain Name System (DNS), but differs in that it gives stronger guarantees on ownership and security, has no trusted parties or "root servers", and is completely decentralized. For more information, visit the BNS wiki.
