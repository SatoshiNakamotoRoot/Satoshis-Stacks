# Using the Blockstack browser

The Blockstack browser is a web application for exploring and using the
decentralized Internet. The decentralized internet is an internet in which users
control the access to their data. This data is both data about them personally,
name, birthdate, phone number. And it is data about what they do such as visited
a website or purchased a product.

The Blockstack browser contains tools for controlling your personal data.
Through the browser, you create an identity in the decentralized interent. Then,
you  use the browser to find and interact with decentralized applications
(dapps) using your identity.

Developers install the browser in a local environment for testing
decentralized applications (dapps) during development.

# Create a Blockstack ID

To use the browser or to develop a decentralized application you require a
Blockstack ID, for example `moxiegirl.id.blockstack`. A Blockstack ID is a
digital identity that is registered With Blockstack. Your personal data and
storage are built around this ID. Decnetralized applications that want to access
your data need your identity and your permission.

To create an ID, do the following:

1. Open the [Blockstack web Applications in your browser](https://browser.blockstack.org/sign-up?redirect=%2F).

   The application prompts you for an email address.

   You use this email address to recover your identity. The application limits
   you to one id per email address. If you have multiple email addresses, you
   are free to have multiple Blockstack IDs.

2. Enter an email address and press **Next**.

   They application prompts you to enter a password.

3. Enter a password, confirm it, and press **Next**.

   You'll learn more about this password later. For now, ensure you store it in
   a safe place. **The Blockstack team cannot restore your password for you.**

3. Register a Blockstack id (username) and press **Check Availability**.

   This is your identity in the Blockstack network. The application limits
   you to one id per email address. If you have multiple email addresses, you
   are free to have multiple Blockstack IDs.  The format of the id is:

    _`username`_`.id.blockstack`

    When you choose an id that is available, the system responds with the following:

    ![](images/create-id-3.png)


4.  Press **Continue**.

    The system prompts you to save your **Recovery Key**.  A recovery key is a
    sequence of 12 words.  These words allow you to recover an `id.blockstack`
    that you've created.  You should store the words along with their order, for
    example,  `#1 pink` and so forth.

5. Click **I have written down all the words** when you are done.

   The system places you in the Blockstack browser.  You can begin using dapps.



## Install a local Blockstack browser

You have Blockstack Browser installed: If you start from ADD USERNAME from IDs window, jump to 6.
1/ You do not have the Blockstack Browser installed: go to https://explorer.blockstack.org/ 67
2/ Search for your name typing “yourname.id” on the search box. If your .id is “free”, the response will be “Ooops ! The name yourname.id doesn’t exist.” or will show a owner “mnbhbu235j46ijnowejjybjb” with Expires field empty and just NAME_IMPORT, no NAME_REGISTRATION.

10/ Wait until you see the bitcoin amount in your wallet. Sometimes bitcoin net can take a minute or one hour (or 5) to perform the transaction depending on the demand of network operations, in the following link you will see approx. the time it will take to complete the transaction based on your fee: https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/ 18
