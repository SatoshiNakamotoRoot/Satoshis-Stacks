The first paragraph of page 8, "Atomic swaps with a native Blockstack token do not require third-party services and can more expressive conditions for exchange of assets." is missing a word after "services and can".

Perhaps you mean "Atomic swaps with a native Blockstack token do not require third-party services and can enable more expressive conditions for exchange of assets."?
