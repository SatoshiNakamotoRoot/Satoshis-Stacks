### Giving feedback on Blockstack whitepapers 

We love getting feedback from our open-source community on the whitepapers. The two papers we're currently most interested in getting feedback on are:

1. Blockstack [technical whitepaper](../whitepaper.pdf)
2. Blockstack [token whitepaper](../tokenpaper.pdf)

To give your feedback, follow these instructions: 

1. Fork this repo. 
2. Add a new .md file in the papers/feedback directory with a name like tokenpaper_feedback_muneeb_oct_2017.md
3. Fill out your comments. Make sure to include page numbers for specific comments. 
4. Submit a pull request. 

We'll generally accept most/all pull requests for feedback. Sending negative feedback is totally fine just please be polite. 
The only exception for not accepting a feedback pull request is if someone is spreading misinformation.

If you prefer to submit your feedback privately, you can email it to token@blockstack.com.

This directory can also help us acknowledge and thank people. Feel free to ask any questions and thanks for taking the time to help improve the whitepapers!
