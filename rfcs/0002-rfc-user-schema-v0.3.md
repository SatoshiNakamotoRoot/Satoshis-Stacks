## User Schema RFC (v0.3)

The ONS User Schema v0.2 is planned to be phased out and v0.3 will gradually take its place. Here we present a request for comments for the new v0.3 schema.

[View the full JSON schema](/openspecs/userschema_rfc/schema.py).

### Sections

#### Basics

A user's basic information, including their name, location and bio.

#### Photos

A user's photos, including their avatar and cover photo.

#### Payments

A user's payment details for various payment methods, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A user may provide proof of ownership by signing a message stating their blockchain handle and including it in their profile.

#### Profiles

A user's social network profiles. A user can provide the appropriate usernames or urls, as well as provide proof of ownership of their accounts by referencing posts that only they could have produced (tweets, gists, etc.).

#### Websites

A list of a user's websites. A user can establish proof of ownership outside of this schema by placing a file in their website's directory (potentially either the root directory or .well-known directory) that references them as an owner or team member of the organization that runs the site.

#### PGP

A user's PGP key. A user may provide proof of ownership by signing a message stating their blockchain handle and including it in their profile.

#### Email

A user's email addresses.
